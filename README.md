Created an interactive webpage showing the level of biodiversity in belly buttons.

The dropdown menu shows the list of microbes by their sample number.  Based on the sample number, a bar chart showing the top 10 operational taxonomic units (OTU) found with that sample number.  A bubble chart shows the count that these OTUs appear.  Lastly, there is a gauge counter that displays the washing frequency of the subject.
